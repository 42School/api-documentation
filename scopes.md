## Scopes

App can have different access scopes.

Authorization scopes are a way to determine to what extent the client can use resources located in the provider.

When the client requests the authorization it specifies in which scope they would like to be authorized. This information is then displayed to the user - resource owner - and they can decide whether or not they accept the given application to be able to act in specified scopes.
